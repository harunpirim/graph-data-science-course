# Step-by-Step Guide: Creating and Pushing New Notebooks

This guide provides detailed instructions for creating new Jupyter notebooks and pushing them to your GitHub repository with working Google Colab links.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Automated Method)

### Step 1: Generate Notebooks Using the Script

```bash
# Run the automated script to create notebooks
python create_all_notebooks.py
```

This will create:
- `02-connectivity.ipynb`
- `03-graph-machine-learning.ipynb`

### Step 2: Add and Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add all new notebooks
git add notebooks/*.ipynb

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add connectivity and GML notebooks with Google Colab compatibility"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

### Step 3: Test Google Colab Links

Your Google Colab links will now work:
- https://colab.research.google.com/github/harunpirim/graph-data-science-course/blob/main/notebooks/02-connectivity.ipynb
- https://colab.research.google.com/github/harunpirim/graph-data-science-course/blob/main/notebooks/03-graph-machine-learning.ipynb

## üìù Manual Method (Step-by-Step)

### Method 1: Using Python Scripts

#### Step 1: Create a Notebook Generation Script

Create a file `create_single_notebook.py`:

```python
import json

def create_notebook(filename, title, cells):
    """Create a Jupyter notebook with the given cells"""
    notebook = {
        "cells": cells,
        "metadata": {
            "kernelspec": {
                "display_name": "Python 3",
                "language": "python",
                "name": "python3"
            },
            "language_info": {
                "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3},
                "file_extension": ".py",
                "mimetype": "text/x-python",
                "name": "python",
                "nbconvert_exporter": "python",
                "pygments_lexer": "ipython3",
                "version": "3.8.5"
            }
        },
        "nbformat": 4,
        "nbformat_minor": 4
    }
    
    with open(f'notebooks/{filename}', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(notebook, f, indent=1)
    
    print(f"Created {filename} successfully!")

# Define your notebook cells
cells = [
    {
        "cell_type": "markdown",
        "metadata": {},
        "source": [
            "# Your Notebook Title\n",
            "\n",
            "Description of your notebook content."
        ]
    },
    {
        "cell_type": "code",
        "execution_count": None,
        "metadata": {},
        "outputs": [],
        "source": [
            "# Your code here\n",
            "import networkx as nx\n",
            "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
            "print('Hello, Graph Data Science!')"
        ]
    }
]

# Create the notebook
create_notebook("your-notebook-name.ipynb", "Your Notebook Title", cells)
```

#### Step 2: Run the Script

```bash
python create_single_notebook.py
```

#### Step 3: Add to Git and Push

```bash
# Add the new notebook
git add notebooks/your-notebook-name.ipynb

# Commit
git commit -m "Add your-notebook-name notebook"

# Push
git push
```

### Method 2: Using Jupyter Notebook Directly

#### Step 1: Create Notebook in Jupyter

```bash
# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

#### Step 2: Create New Notebook

1. Click "New" ‚Üí "Python 3"
2. Add your content (markdown and code cells)
3. Save as `notebooks/your-notebook-name.ipynb`

#### Step 3: Add to Git and Push

```bash
# Add the notebook
git add notebooks/your-notebook-name.ipynb

# Commit
git commit -m "Add your-notebook-name notebook"

# Push
git push
```

### Method 3: Using Google Colab

#### Step 1: Create in Google Colab

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Create a new notebook
3. Add your content

#### Step 2: Download and Add to Repository

1. File ‚Üí Download ‚Üí Download .ipynb
2. Move the file to `notebooks/your-notebook-name.ipynb`
3. Add to Git and push

## üîß Notebook Structure Template

Here's a template for creating well-structured notebooks:

```python
# Template for creating a new notebook
notebook_cells = [
    # Title and Introduction
    {
        "cell_type": "markdown",

## üìã Checklist for New Notebooks

### Before Creating:
- [ ] Decide on the topic and learning objectives
- [ ] Plan the structure (sections, examples, visualizations)
- [ ] Choose appropriate datasets or examples

### During Creation:
- [ ] Use clear, descriptive markdown cells
- [ ] Include code comments and explanations
- [ ] Add visualizations where appropriate
- [ ] Test code cells to ensure they work
- [ ] Include real-world examples

### Before Pushing:
- [ ] Test the notebook locally
- [ ] Ensure all imports are included
- [ ] Check that visualizations render correctly
- [ ] Verify the notebook structure is correct

### After Pushing:
- [ ] Test the Google Colab link
- [ ] Update the README.md if needed
- [ ] Share with students/colleagues

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. Notebook Won't Open in Google Colab
**Solution**: Ensure the notebook has the correct JSON structure and is properly committed to GitHub.

#### 2. Import Errors in Google Colab
**Solution**: Add installation commands at the beginning of your notebook:
```python
# Install required packages
!pip install networkx matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn
```

#### 3. Large File Size
**Solution**: Remove output cells and large data before committing:
```bash
# Clean notebook (remove outputs)
jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace notebooks/your-notebook.ipynb
```

#### 4. Git Issues
**Solution**: Check your git status and resolve conflicts:
```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Content:
- Start with clear learning objectives
- Use progressive complexity (simple to advanced)
- Include real-world examples
- Provide clear explanations for each concept
- End with a summary and key insights

### Code:
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add comments to explain complex code
- Include error handling where appropriate
- Test all code cells before pushing

### Documentation:
- Use descriptive markdown cells
- Include references and citations
- Provide links to additional resources
- Add contact information for questions

### Version Control:
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Commit frequently with small changes
- Test notebooks after each major change
- Keep backup copies of important notebooks
