# Introduction to Network Science

## Overview

Network Science is the study of complex systems represented as networks (graphs) where entities are nodes and relationships are edges. This field combines elements from mathematics, computer science, physics, and social sciences to understand how interconnected systems behave.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:
- Understand basic network science concepts and terminology
- Identify different types of networks and their properties
- Analyze fundamental network metrics
- Recognize real-world applications of network science
- Follow a systematic approach to network analysis

## 1. What is Network Science?

### Definition
Network Science is the study of complex systems as networks, where:
- **Nodes** (vertices) represent entities (people, computers, proteins, etc.)
- **Edges** (links) represent relationships or interactions between entities

### Key Concepts
- **Graph Theory**: Mathematical foundation for network analysis
- **Complex Systems**: Systems with many interacting components
- **Emergent Properties**: Behaviors that arise from interactions, not individual components

### Historical Context
- **1736**: Euler's solution to the Königsberg bridge problem
- **1950s-60s**: Development of graph theory in mathematics
- **1990s**: Emergence of "small-world" and "scale-free" networks
- **2000s**: Network Science as a distinct interdisciplinary field

## 2. Types of Networks

### Undirected Networks
- Edges have no direction (e.g., friendship networks)
- Symmetric relationships
- Example: Facebook friendships

### Directed Networks
- Edges have direction (e.g., following on social media)
- Asymmetric relationships
- Example: Twitter followers

### Weighted Networks
- Edges have weights (e.g., communication frequency)
- Quantitative relationships
- Example: Email communication volume

### Bipartite Networks
- Two types of nodes
- Edges only between different types
- Example: Users and movies in recommendation systems

### Temporal Networks
- Networks that change over time
- Dynamic relationships
- Example: Communication networks over time

## 3. Basic Network Properties

### Size Metrics
- **Number of nodes (N)**: Total entities in the network
- **Number of edges (E)**: Total relationships
- **Density**: Ratio of actual edges to possible edges
  - Formula: `density = 2E / (N × (N-1))` for undirected networks

### Connectivity
- **Connected component**: Subset of nodes where any two nodes are connected by a path
- **Giant component**: Largest connected component
- **Isolated nodes**: Nodes with no connections

### Degree Distribution
- **Degree**: Number of connections a node has
- **Average degree**: Mean number of connections per node
- **Degree distribution**: Distribution of degrees across all nodes

### Path Properties
- **Path**: Sequence of edges connecting two nodes
- **Shortest path**: Minimum number of edges between two nodes
- **Diameter**: Maximum shortest path length in the network
- **Average path length**: Mean shortest path length between all pairs

## 4. Network Models

### Random Networks (Erdős-Rényi)
- Each pair of nodes connected with probability p
- Poisson degree distribution
- Low clustering coefficient

### Small-World Networks (Watts-Strogatz)
- High clustering like regular networks
- Short path lengths like random networks
- Created by rewiring regular networks

### Scale-Free Networks (Barabási-Albert)
- Power-law degree distribution
- Preferential attachment mechanism
- Few highly connected hubs, many poorly connected nodes

## 5. Real-World Network Examples
