## Overview

Network Science is the study of complex systems represented as networks (graphs) where entities are nodes and relationships are edges. This field combines elements from mathematics, computer science, physics, and social sciences to understand how interconnected systems behave.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:
- Understand basic network science concepts and terminology
- Identify different types of networks and their properties
- Analyze fundamental network metrics
- Recognize real-world applications of network science


## 1. What is Network Science?

### Definition
Network Science is the study of complex systems as networks, where:
- **Nodes** (vertices) represent entities (people, computers, proteins, etc.)
- **Edges** (links) represent relationships or interactions between entities

### Key Concepts
- **Graph Theory**: Mathematical foundation for network analysis
- **Complex Systems**: Systems with many interacting components
- **Emergent Properties**: Behaviors that arise from interactions, not individual components

### Historical Context
- **1736**: Euler's solution to the Königsberg bridge problem
- **1950s-60s**: Development of graph theory in mathematics
- **1990s**: Emergence of "small-world" and "scale-free" networks
- **2000s**: Network Science as a distinct interdisciplinary field

## 2. Types of Networks

### Undirected Networks
- Edges have no direction (e.g., friendship networks)
- Symmetric relationships
- Example: Facebook friendships

### Directed Networks
- Edges have direction (e.g., following on social media)
- Asymmetric relationships
- Example: Twitter followers

### Weighted Networks
- Edges have weights (e.g., communication frequency)
- Quantitative relationships
- Example: Email communication volume

### Bipartite Networks
- Two types of nodes
- Edges only between different types
- Example: Users and movies in recommendation systems

### Temporal Networks
- Networks that change over time
- Dynamic relationships
- Example: Communication networks over time


## Simple Graph Examples

### Example 1: A Basic Undirected Graph
```
    A ——— B
    |     |
    |     |
    D ——— C
```

**Nodes:** A, B, C, D
**Arcs:** A-B, B-C, C-D, D-A

This creates a square where each vertex connects to its neighbors. Notice that in an undirected graph, we can travel from any connected node to another in either direction.

### Example 2: A Directed Graph (Digraph)
```
    A ——→ B
    ↑     ↓
    |     |
    D ←—— C
```

**Nodes:** A, B, C, D
**Directed Arcs:** A→B, B→C, C→D, D→A

Here, the arrows show direction. You can go from A to B, but not necessarily from B to A without following the complete cycle.

## More Complex Graph Structures

### Example 3: A Social Network
```
      Alice
     /  |  \
    /   |   \
   Bob  |    Charlie
    \   |   /   |
     \  |  /    |
      David ——— Eve
```

**Nodes:** Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve
**Relationships:**
- Alice knows: Bob, Charlie, David
- Bob knows: Alice, David
- Charlie knows: Alice, David, Eve
- David knows: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Eve
- Eve knows: Charlie, David

This represents a friendship network where Alice is highly connected (a hub), while Eve is more peripheral.

### Example 4: A Transportation Network
```
    Airport A ←——→ Airport B
        ↓              ↓
        ↓              ↓
    Airport C ←——→ Airport D
        ↓              ↑
        ↓              |
    Airport E ——————→ Airport F
```

**Flight Routes:**
- A ↔ B (bidirectional flights)
- A → C (one-way route)
- B → D (one-way route)
- C ↔ D (bidirectional flights)
- C → E (one-way route)
- E → F (one-way route)
- F → D (one-way route)

## Graph Properties and Terminology

### Degree of a Node
The **degree** of a node is the number of arcs connected to it.

In our social network example:
- Alice has degree 3 (connected to Bob, Charlie, David)
- David has degree 4 (connected to Alice, Bob, Charlie, Eve)
- Eve has degree 2 (connected to Charlie, David)

### Paths and Cycles
A **path** is a sequence of nodes connected by arcs. A **cycle** is a path that starts and ends at the same node.

Path example: Alice → David → Eve
Cycle example: A → B → C → D → A

### Connected vs. Disconnected Graphs
```
Connected Graph:       Disconnected Graph:
    A ——— B               A ——— B    E ——— F
    |     |               |     |       
    |     |               |     |       
    D ——— C               D ——— C    
```

## Special Types of Graphs

### Tree Structure
A tree is a connected graph with no cycles - like a family tree or file system.

```
        Root
       /  |  \
      /   |   \
     A    B    C
    / \       / \
   D   E     F   G
```

### Complete Graph
A complete graph connects every node to every other node.

```
Complete Graph with 4 nodes:
    A ——— B
    |\   /|
    | \ / |
    |  X  |
    | / \ |
    |/   \|
    D ——— C
```

### Weighted Graphs
Sometimes arcs have values (weights) representing cost, distance, or strength of connection.

```
    A ——5—— B
    |       |
    3       7
    |       |
    D ——2—— C
```

The numbers represent distances, costs, or other measurable relationships.


## 3. Basic Network Properties

### Size Metrics
- **Number of nodes (N)**: Total entities in the network

## Key Insights for Learning

When you encounter any system with relationships, try to identify:
1. What are the entities? (These become your nodes)
2. How do they connect? (These become your arcs)
3. Do the connections have direction? (Directed vs. undirected)
4. Do the connections have different strengths or costs? (Weighted vs. unweighted)

Graph theory provides a powerful language for describing and analyzing these relationships, making complex systems easier to understand and optimize.

## Practice Exercise

Try modeling your own social network or the websites you visit regularly as a graph. Identify the nodes and arcs, and consider what insights you might gain from analyzing the structure. What patterns do you notice? Who or what serves as important connection points?
