# Centrality in Networks

## Introduction

Centrality measures are fundamental concepts in network analysis that help us identify the most important nodes in a network. While degree centrality is the most basic measure, there are several other centrality metrics that provide different perspectives on node importance.

## Types of Centrality Measures

### 1. Degree Centrality

Degree centrality is the simplest centrality measure, calculated as the number of edges connected to a node.

**Mathematical Definition:**
For node $j$, the degree $d_j$ is calculated as:

$d_j = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_{ij}$

where $A_{ij}$ is the element of the adjacency matrix of the network.

**Directed Networks:**
In directed networks, we distinguish between:
- **In-degree**: Number of edges pointing to a node
  $d_j^{\text{(in)}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_{ij}$
- **Out-degree**: Number of edges pointing from a node
  $d_i^{(out)} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{ij}$

### 2. Closeness Centrality

Closeness centrality measures how close a node is to all other nodes in the network.

**Mathematical Definition:**
For node $j$, closeness centrality $c_j$ is calculated as:

$c_j = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_{ij}}$

where $d_{ij}$ is the shortest path distance between node $i$ and node $j$.

**Interpretation:**
- High closeness centrality means the node is close to all other nodes
- The node can reach all other nodes with short paths
- Useful for identifying nodes that can efficiently spread information

### 3. Betweenness Centrality

Betweenness centrality measures how often a node lies on the shortest paths between other nodes.

**Mathematical Definition:**
For node $j$, betweenness centrality $b_j$ is calculated as:

$b_j = \sum_{s\neq t\neq j} \frac{\sigma_{st}(j)}{\sigma_{st}}$

where:
- $\sigma_{st}$ is the number of shortest paths between node $s$ and node $t$
- $\sigma_{st}(j)$ is the number of shortest paths between node $s$ and node $t$ that pass through node $j$

**Interpretation:**
- High betweenness centrality means the node is a bridge between different parts of the network
- These nodes control the flow of information or resources
- Critical for network connectivity

### 4. Eigenvector Centrality

Eigenvector centrality considers not just the number of connections, but also the quality of those connections.

**Mathematical Definition:**
For node $j$, eigenvector centrality $x_j$ is calculated as:

$x_j = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{ij} x_j$

This can be written in matrix form as:
$Av = \lambda{v}$

where:
- $A_{ij}$ is the adjacency matrix element
- $x_i$ is the eigenvector centrality of node $i$
- $\lambda$ is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix

**Interpretation:**
- High eigenvector centrality means the node is connected to other important nodes
- Similar to degree centrality but with a feedback loop
- Useful for identifying influential nodes in social networks

### 5. PageRank Centrality

PageRank is a variant of eigenvector centrality that includes a damping factor to handle directed networks with sinks.

**Mathematical Definition:**
For node $i$, PageRank centrality $x_i$ is calculated as:

$x_i = \frac{1-d}{N} + d \sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{A_{ij}}{d_{j}^{out}} x_j$

where:
- $d$ is the damping factor (typically 0.85)
- $N$ is the total number of nodes
- $d_{j}^{out}$ is the out-degree of node $j$

**Interpretation:**
- Combines random walk with teleportation
- Handles directed networks better than eigenvector centrality
- Originally developed for ranking web pages

## Key Differences Between Centrality Measures

| Centrality Type | What it measures | Best for identifying |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Degree | Number of connections | Most connected nodes |
| Closeness | Average distance to others | Information spreaders |
| Betweenness | Bridge role in network | Network bottlenecks |
| Eigenvector | Connection to important nodes | Influential nodes |
| PageRank | Importance with damping | Web-like structures |

## Applications

1. **Social Networks**: Identifying influential users
2. **Transportation Networks**: Finding critical junctions
3. **Biological Networks**: Discovering key proteins or genes
4. **Information Networks**: Locating information hubs
5. **Economic Networks**: Finding key economic actors

## Computational Considerations

- **Degree centrality**: O(E) time complexity
- **Closeness centrality**: O(V²) for dense networks, O(V+E) for sparse networks
- **Betweenness centrality**: O(VE) for unweighted, O(VE + V² log V) for weighted
- **Eigenvector centrality**: O(V³) for exact computation, O(V²) for power iteration
- **PageRank**: O(V²) per iteration, typically converges in 10-20 iterations
